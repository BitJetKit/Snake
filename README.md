Snake
=====

Old school snake with beautiful, modern graphics.  Available on the [Android Market](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nickeyre.snake)

Control the snake as it picks up food but don't hit anything! This snake has multiple view modes which fit in beautifully with the Holo theme on Android Ice Cream Sandwich and Jelly Bean phones and tablets.

This game uses an intuitive "snake-oriented" approach to controls. Instead of a four directional arrow pad, simply turn the snake left or right to adjust its course.

The app is simple and responsive with no unnecessary permissions requested. The app follows the Android styling guidelines and is overall very nice to the eye. The graphics automatically scale to fit screens of any size, phone or tablet.
